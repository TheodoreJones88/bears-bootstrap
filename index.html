      <p>
        Many have been asking... "What makes this card game different than others?", well I'll start by saying our
        cards
        are
        alive!! yes thats right... ALIVE!!! once you pull a card a little hologram of the character will come to life
        and
        fight on your behalf. The Characters opperate from voice command and will not work for anyone else. Character
        cards
        start off on level 1 and the more you battle the stronger they get!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways to level up your cards. One way is to battle as we've told you but another is
        training.
        Training isn't as effective as battling but it is a constant way to level up when there's no one to battle.
        Another
        way is feeding your characters Special Sensu Beans that you can gain from deepinging your connection with your
        card.
        The last way is to fuse with another card (fuses are permanent) that will combine the two levels of the
        characters
        and half of that total together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cards are completely responsive to your voice and the more you talk to them the better and faster the
        react.
        Connection and level strength are equally important in this card game. One could have a lvl 100 card while the
        other
        has a lvl 50, but if the lvl 50 has a better connection then he has a better chance of winning. This doesn't
        mean
        that he will win but it will give him a better chance. Collect your first card today and harness the raw power
        of
        you favorite Dragonball Character!
